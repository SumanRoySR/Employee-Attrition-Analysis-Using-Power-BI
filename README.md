# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-Using-Power-BI
Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition data to identify critical trends and insights that can support HR teams in minimizing turnover and improving employee retention strategies. 
This dashboard provides a clear picture of who is leaving, why they might be leaving, and when they are most likely to leave.

KPIs:
•	Total Employees: 1,470
•	Total Attrition Count: 237
•	Overall Attrition Rate: 16.1%
•	Average Age: 36.9 years
•	Average Salary: ₹6.50K
•	Average Work-Life Balance Score: 2.76

Key Insights:
The majority of employee attrition is concentrated in the lower salary bracket, with 163 employees earning up to ₹5K leaving the organization, followed by 49 in the ₹5K–₹10K range, 20 in the ₹10K–₹15K range, and only 5 employees from the ₹15K+ category. This trend suggests a strong correlation between lower salary and higher attrition.
Age-wise, employees aged 26–35 accounted for the highest attrition (116), followed by the 18–25 age group (44), 36–45 (43), 46–55 (26), and the 55+ age group (8). This indicates that younger and mid-career professionals are more likely to leave.
From a job role perspective, Sales Executives reported the highest attrition count at 326, closely followed by Research Scientists (292) and Laboratory Technicians (259). Manufacturing Directors had comparatively lower attrition at 145. These figures help pinpoint which roles experience the highest turnover.
Education-wise, employees with a background in Life Sciences showed the highest attrition rate at 37.55%, followed by Medical (26.58%), Marketing (14.77%), Technical Degree holders (13.5%), Other (4.64%), and Human Resources (2.95%). This data highlights the need for deeper investigation into field-specific satisfaction and career expectations.
Lastly, job satisfaction ratings indicate that the highest attrition occurs among employees with satisfaction level 4, with Laboratory Technicians (62) and Research Scientists (47) being the most impacted. This suggests that even moderately satisfied employees may still be leaving, possibly due to other external or internal organizational factors.

Conclusion:
This HR analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee attrition by uncovering the "who," "why," and "when" of turnover. By leveraging visual insights, HR teams can implement targeted retention strategies, focus on high-risk groups, and enhance employee satisfaction.
This project is an excellent example of how business intelligence tools like Power BI can turn complex HR data into clear, actionable insights.
